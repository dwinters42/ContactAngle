<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Apart form the source code, you will need the
[http://opencv.willowgarage.com|OpenCV] library, the
[http://www.wxwidgets.org|wxWidgets] toolkit, the
[http://cmake.org|cmake] build system and a working C++ compiler.

On an e.g. Debian or Ubuntu, the following should do the job:

<verbatim>
apt-get install build-essential cmake libcv-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev   
</verbatim>

On Windows, you can get the libraries precompiled from their
corresponding websites and you can use e.g. the free Microsoft Visual
Studio 2008 (or 2010) Express.

<h2>Get the source code</h2>

Currently, the only way to get the source code is to clone the
[http://www.fossil-scm.org|fossil] repository from this website:

<verbatim>
fossil clone $base_url ContactAngle.fossil
mkdir ContactAngle
cd ContactAngle
fossil open ../ContactAngle.fossil
</verbatim>

<h2>Build on Unix</h2>

In the source directory run the following:

<verbatim>
cmake .
make
sudo make install
</verbatim>

<h2>Build on Windows</h2>

Open cmake-gui, set the source and build directory to the ContacAngle
source dir, press configure (for eg. Visual Studio), press generate.

Open the generated ContactAngle.sln in Visual Studio, build
solution. This will give you the binary in the Release. or Debug/
directory, depending on your build configuration.
