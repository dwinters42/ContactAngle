This is the homepage for <b>ContactAngle</b>, a simple and easy-to-use
program to extract contact angles from videos of liquid droplets on a
surface.

<h2>News</h2>

24/1/2011: first public release of version 0.2

<h2>About the program</h2>

The program is free and open source under a BSD license and will work
on various flavours of BSD, Linux and Windows (and possibly MacOS
X). It uses the [http://opencv.willowgarage.com/|OpenCV] computer
vision library for image processing and the
[http://www.wxwidgets.org|wxWidgets] toolkit for the user interface.

It was originally created to optimise layer structures for digital
microfluidic (DMF) devices for work done at the
[http://www.sircams.ed.ac.uk/emsg/index.html|EMSG research group] at
the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. The reason for writing it
was that we had no access to a commercial program that would reliably
and quickly extract contact angles from videos with hundreds of
frames. 

The author is Daniel Winters <daniel@tydirium.org>.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

The program takes a very simple approach like the following:

  *  Read a frame from the video
  *  Binary threshold (convert it to black and white)
  *  Detect the shape of the droplet in an area close to where it touches 
     the surface
  *  Fit a parabola for each side and take the contact angle as the slope 
     of the function at the point where it touches the surface.
  *  Repeat for all frames in movie

This simple approach is robust and fast, but may not be as precise as
other algorithms that user a larger part of the image. However, it is
accurate enough for most purposes (did I mention it is free?).

For a description of how to use it, look [./Usage.wiki|here].

<h2>Known problems and caveats</h2>

  *   It looks extremely ugly on Windows (this could be changed, though).
  *   It may not be as precise as some commercial programs (but it does
      the job).
