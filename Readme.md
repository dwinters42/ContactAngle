About
=====

ContactAngle is a software tool to measure the liquid contact angle of
a droplet on a surface in images or videos. The contact angle is an
important parameter in surface chemistry.

The program was originally created to help with optimising layer
structures for digital microfluidic (DMF) devices for work done at the
[EMSG research group](http://www.sircams.ed.ac.uk/emsg/) located at
the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. The reason for writing it
was that we had no access to a commercial program that would reliably
and quickly extract contact angles from videos with hundreds of
video frames.

ContactAngle was written and is still maintained by Daniel Winters
<daniel@tydirium.org>. It is open source under a BSD license and will
work on all flavours of BSD, Linux and Windows. It uses the
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library for image
processing and the [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org) toolkit for
the user interface.

The software comes without any warranty. Use it at your own risk, I
will take no responsibility or liability if something breaks or goes
wrong.
